- `homotopical-methods-complex-geometry-GSTGC21`: a whirlwind tour through some places in complex geometry where topology and homotopy theory plays a fundamental role, from the Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference 2021.
- `simplicial-connections-stockholm`: a talk I gave at a seminar at Stockholm University introducing the main ideas from my thesis (simplicial connections, twisting cochains).
- `twisting-cochains-YTM19`: from Young Topologists Meeting 2019 at EPFL on twisting cochains, twisted complexes, and other related aspects.
